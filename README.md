# Datahub
This repository provides **datasets** to some other projects which use them mainly as input in prototyping and test-driving tools [(see listing)](https://github.com/dbautistav/datahub#used-in).

## Catalog
- [Datasets catalog.](https://github.com/dbautistav/datahub/catalog.json)

## Sources
- [Ecobici (CDMX) usage data.](https://www.ecobici.df.gob.mx/es/informacion-del-servicio/open-data)

## Why JSON?
- [It seems](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/blob/gh-pages/index.html#L209) that GitHub Pages only [gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip#Derivatives_and_other_uses)'s JSON files which is specially useful for large datasets.

## Used in
- [Crossfilter-TestDrive](https://github.com/dbautistav/Crossfilter-TestDrive)
- [workers](https://github.com/dbautistav/workers) (WIP)
