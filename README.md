# Datahub
This repo provides **datasets** to some other projects which use them as input mainly in prototyping and test-driving tools.

## Datasets
- [Ecobici (CDMX)](https://www.ecobici.df.gob.mx/es/informacion-del-servicio/open-data)

## Why JSON?
[It seems](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/blob/gh-pages/index.html#L209) that GitHub Pages only [gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip#Derivatives_and_other_uses)'s JSON files which is specially useful for large datasets.
